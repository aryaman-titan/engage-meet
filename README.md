Application of Agile Methodology
--------------------------------
<br>
Microsoft and the Acehacker team kept various sessions for us to learn more about the work culture at Microsoft. We also learned about new technologies that have been developed by Microsoft and about the Agile Methodology. <br><br>

The <strong>Agile Scrum Methodology</strong> has heavily influenced my work in the past 1 month. 
Agile scrum methodology is a project management system that relies on incremental development. Each iteration consists of 2-4 sprints, where each sprint's goal is to build the most important features first and come out with a potentially deliverable product. <br>
Microsoft assigned us three sprints of 1-2 weeks each: <strong>Design, Build, and Adopt.</strong><br><br>
In the <strong>first two weeks</strong>, I made a basic MVP with all the minimum functionalities running, including wireframing.

In the <strong>third and fourth week</strong>, I worked on adding additional features to my web app, with the feedback received from mentors. Also I learned about CI/CD and integrated Github Actions with my project. <br>

In the <strong>last week</strong>, I ended up adding various additional features like virtual background and disappearing messages. Also had a hands-on experience on dockerizing my application and deploying it to production. <br><br>
## Prerequisites

You must have the following installed:

- [Node.js v12+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
## Build Instructions

Running the Web App on your Local System
--------------------------------

To run the web app in your local device, run the following commands in your terminal:-

Clone the GitHub repository into your local device by running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryaman-titan/engage-meet

cd engage-meet
```

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!
